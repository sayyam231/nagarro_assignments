        <p style="text-align:justify;">Pokémon is a Japanese media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, a company founded by Nintendo, Game
            Freak, and Creatures.
            The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1996, and is centered on fictional creatures called
            "Pokémon".
            The name Pokémon is a syllabic abbreviation of the Japanese brand Pocket Monsters.[25] The term "Pokémon",
            in addition to referring to the Pokémon franchise itself, also collectively refers to the 905 fictional
            species that have made appearances in Pokémon media as of the release of the eighth generation titles
            Pokémon Sword and Shield. "Pokémon" is identical in the singular and plural, as is each individual species
            name; it is and would be grammatically correct to say "one Pokémon" and "many Pokémon", as well as "one
            Pikachu" and "many Pikachu
